## <u> OSI Model and TCP Model</u>
- **The OSI Model** we just looked at is just a reference/logical model. It was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components. 

- **The TCP/IP model** is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model. 

| Layer | Device Type | OSI Layer | TCP/IP model | TCP/IP New (actual) | Protocols | PDU
--|--|--|--|--|--|--
7 | Gateway | **Application** | Application| Application | HTTP, FTP, POP, SMTP, DNS, RIP | Data
6 | -       | **Presentation**| Application| Application | HTTP, FTP, POP, SMTP, DNS, RIP, MIME | Data
5 | -       | **Session**     | Application| Application | HTTP, FTP, POP, SMTP, DNS, RIP, SCP | Data
4 | -       | **Transport**   | Transport  | Transport | TCP/UDP | Segments
3 | Router  | **Network**     | Internet   | Network | IP, ARP, ICMP, IGMP | Packets
2 | Switch/bridge | **Data Link** | Link   | Data Link | Ethernet, Token Ring | Frames
1 | Hubs/Repeater | **Physical**  | Link   | Physical | Ethernet, Token Ring | Bits

#### ✅ TCP Connection establishment process 
1. **Host A** sends out a **SYN** (synchronize) packet with proposed initial sequence number to Host B.
2. **Host B** receives **SYN** message, it returns a packet with both SYN and ACK flags (**SYN-ACK**) set in the [TCP header](https://www.gatevidyalay.com/transmission-control-protocol-tcp-header/).
3. **Host A** receives the **SYN-ACK**, it sends back **ACK** (Acknowledgment) packet.
4. **Host B** receives **ACK** and at this stage the connection is **ESTABLISHED.**

#### ❌ TCP Connection termination
1. **Host A** sends a **FIN** (finish) flag, indicating that is has finished sending the data.
2. **Host B** who receives the **FIN**, doest not terminate the connection but enters into a "passive close" (CLOSE_WAIT) state and sends the **ACK** for the **FIN** back to the Host A.
3. **Host A** enters into a (TIME_WAIT) state, and sends an **ACK** back to the Host B.
4. **Host B** gets the **ACK** from the Host A and **closes the connection.**

⚠️ *Sequence numbers increase on new communication.  Example is computers A and B.  A would increment B's sequence number.  A would never increment it's own sequence.*

### <u>TCP Flags</u>

| Flag | Name           | Function                                                     |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SYN  | Synchronize    | Set during initial communication.  Negotiating of parameters and sequence numbers |
| ACK  | Acknowledgment | Set as an acknowledgement to the SYN flag.  Always set after initial SYN |
| RST  | Reset          | Forces the termination of a connection (in both directions)  |
| FIN  | Finish         | Ordered close to communications                              |
| PSH  | Push           | Forces the delivery of data without concern for buffering    |
| URG  | Urgent         | Data inside is being sent out of band.  Example is cancelling a message |

### <u>Port Numbers</u>

- **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority** (IANA) - maintains Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry which lists all port number reservations

- Ranges

  - **Well-known ports** - 0 - 1023

  - **Registered ports** - 1024 - 49,151

  - **Dynamic ports** - 49,152 - 65,535

    | Port Number | Protocol | Transport Protocol |
    | ----------- | -------- | ------------------ |
    | 20/21       | FTP      | TCP                |
    | 22          | SSH      | TCP                |

    | 514         | SYSLOG   | UDP                |

  - A service is said to be **listening** for a port when it has that specific port open

  - Once a service has made a connection, the port is in an **established** state

  - **`Netstat`** command:

    - Shows open ports on computer
    - **netstat -an** displays connections in numerical form
    - **netstat -b** displays executables tied to the open port (admin only)

### <u>Subnetting</u>

- **IPv4 Main Address Types**
  - **Unicast** - acted on by a single recipient
  - **Multicast** - acted on by members of a specific group
  - **Broadcast** - acted on by everyone on the network
    - **Limited** - delivered to every system in the domain (255.255.255.255)
    - **Directed** - delivered to all devices on a subnet and use that broadcast address
- **Subnet mask** - determines how many address available on a specific subnet
  - Represented by three methods
    - **Decimal** - 255.240.0.0
    - **Binary** - 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000
    - **CIDR** - x.x.x.x/12   (where x.x.x.x is an ip address on that range)
  - If all the bits in the host field are 1s, the address is the broadcast
  - If they are all 0s, it's the network address
  - Any other combination indicates an address in the range
 
- 
### <u>ARP</u>

- Resolves IP address to physical address

### <u>Network Security Zones</u>

- **Internet** - uncontrollable
- **Internet DMZ** - controlled buffer network

### <u>CIA Triad</u>

- **Confidentiality** - passwords, encryption
- **Integrity** - hashing, digital signatures
- **Availability** - anti-dos solutions

**Bit flipping** is an example of an <u>integrity</u> attack.  The outcome is not to gain information - it is to obscure the data from the actual user.

Confidentiality != authentication - MAC address spoofing is an authentication attack

**Infowar** - the use of offensive and defensive techniques to create an advantage

### <u>Hacking Phases</u>

1. **Reconnaissance**  - gathering evidence about targets
2. **Scanning & Enumeration** - obtaining more in-depth information about targets
