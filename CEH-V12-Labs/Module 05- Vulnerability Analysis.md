# Module 05: Vulnerability Analysis

## Scenario

Earlier, all possible information about a target system such as system name, OS details, shared network resources, policies and passwords
details, and users and user groups were gathered.

Now, as an ethical hacker or penetration tester (hereafter, pen tester), your next step is to perform vulnerability research and a
vulnerability assessment on the target system or network. Ethical hackers or pen testers need to conduct intense research with the help of
information acquired in the footprinting and scanning phases to discover vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability assessments scan networks for known security weaknesses: it recognizes, measures, and classifies security vulnerabilities in a
computer system, network, and communication channel; and evaluates the target systems for vulnerabilities such as missing patches,
unnecessary services, weak authentication, and weak encryption. Additionally, it assists security professionals in securing the network by
determining security loopholes or vulnerabilities in the current security mechanism before attackers can exploit them.

The information gleaned from a vulnerability assessment helps you to identify weaknesses that could be exploited and predict the
effectiveness of additional security measures in protecting information resources from attack.

The labs in this module will give you real-time experience in collecting information regarding underlying vulnerabilities in the target
system using various online sources and vulnerability assessment tools.

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to extract information about the target system that includes, but not limited to:

```
Network vulnerabilities
IP and Transmission Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) ports and services that are listening
Application and services configuration errors/vulnerabilities
The OS version running on computers or devices
Applications installed on computers
Accounts with weak passwords
Files and folders with weak permissions
Default services and applications that may have to be uninstalled
Mistakes in the security configuration of common applications
Computers exposed to known or publicly reported vulnerabilities
```
## Overview of Vulnerability Assessment

A vulnerability refers to a weakness in the design or implementation of a system that can be exploited to compromise the security of the
system. It is frequently a security loophole that enables an attacker to enter the system by bypassing user authentication. There are
generally two main causes for vulnerable systems in a network, software or hardware misconfiguration and poor programming practices.
Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to perform various types of attacks on organizational resources.

## Lab Tasks

Ethical hackers or pen testers use numerous tools and techniques to collect information about the underlying vulnerability in a target
system or network. Recommended labs that will assist you in learning various vulnerability assessment techniques include:

1. Perform vulnerability research with vulnerability scoring systems and databases
    Perform vulnerability research in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
    Perform vulnerability research in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
    Perform vulnerability research in National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
2. Perform vulnerability assessment using various vulnerability assessment tools
    Perform vulnerability analysis using OpenVAS
    Perform vulnerability scanning using Nessus
    Perform web servers and applications vulnerability scanning using CGI Scanner Nikto

# Lab 2: Perform Vulnerability Assessment using Various

# Vulnerability Assessment Tools

**Lab Scenario**

The information gathered in the previous labs might not be sufficient to reveal potential vulnerabilities of the target: there could be more
information available that may help in finding loopholes. As an ethical hacker, you should look for as much information as possible using
all available tools. This lab will demonstrate other information that you can extract from the target using various vulnerability assessment
tools.

**Lab Objectives**

```
Perform vulnerability analysis using OpenVAS
Perform vulnerability scanning using Nessus
Perform web servers and applications vulnerability scanning using CGI Scanner Nikto
```
**Overview of Vulnerability Assessment**

A vulnerability assessment is an in-depth examination of the ability of a system or application, including current security procedures and
controls, to withstand exploitation. It scans networks for known security weaknesses, and recognizes, measures, and classifies security
vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and communication channels. It identifies, quantifies, and ranks possible vulnerabilities to
threats in a system. Additionally, it assists security professionals in securing the network by identifying security loopholes or vulnerabilities
in the current security mechanism before attackers can exploit them.

There are two approaches to network vulnerability scanning:

```
Active Scanning
Passive Scanning
```
## Task 1: Perform Vulnerability Analysis using OpenVAS

OpenVAS is a framework of several services and tools offering a comprehensive and powerful vulnerability scanning and vulnerability
management solution. Its capabilities include unauthenticated testing, authenticated testing, various high level and low-level Internet and
industrial protocols, performance tuning for large-scale scans, and a powerful internal programming language to implement any
vulnerability test. The actual security scanner is accompanied with a regularly updated feed of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)—over
50,000 in total.

Here, we will perform a vulnerability analysis using OpenVAS.

Note: In this task, we will use the **Parrot Security (10.10.1.13)** machine as a host machine and the **Windows Server 2022 (10.10.1.22)**
machine as a target machine.

1. Click on **CEHv12 Parrot Security** to switch to the **Parrot Security** machine.
2. In the login page, the **attacker** username will be selected by default. Enter password as **toor** in the **Password** field and press **Enter**

```
Note: A tuning scan can be used to decrease the number of tests performed against a target. By specifying the type of test to
include or exclude, faster and focused testing can be completed. This is useful in situations where the presence of certain file types
such as XSS or simply “interesting” files is undesired.
```
7. In the terminal window, type **nikto -h (Target Website) -Tuning x** (here, the target website is **https://www.certifiedhacker.com** )
    and press **Enter**. Nikto starts scanning with all the tuning options enabled.

```
Note: -h : specifies the target host and x : specifies the Reverse Tuning Options (i.e., include all except specified).
```
```
Note: The scan takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.
```
8. The result appears, displaying various information such as the name of the server, IP address, target port, retrieved files, and
    vulnerabilities details of the target website.

```
Note: The result might differ when you perform this task.
```
9. Here, we will check for cgi directories with the - **Cgidirs** option. In this option, search for specific directories or use **all** options to
    search for all the available directories.
10. In the terminal window, type **nikto -h (Target Website) -Cgidirs all** , (here, the target website is **https://www.certifiedhacker.com** )
and hit **Enter**.

```
Note: -Cgidirs : scans the specified CGI directories; users can use filters such as “none” or “all” to scan all CGI directories or none).
```
```
Note: The scan takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.
```
11. The target website does not have any CGI directory; therefore, the same result as the previous scan was obtained.

```
Note: You can use try this command on another website to obtain information about CGI directories.
```
12. Now, we will save the scan results in the form of a text file on **Desktop**. To do so, type **cd** and press **Enter** to jump to the root
    directory.
13. Type **cd Desktop** and press **Enter** to navigate to the **Desktop** folder.
14. Type **nikto -h (Target Website) -o (File_Name) -F txt** , (here, the target website is **https://www.certifiedhacker.com** ) and press
    **Enter**.

### 


```
Note: -h : specifies the target, -o : specifies the name of the output file, and -F : specifies the file format.
```
```
Note: Name the file Nikto_Scan_Results
```
```
Note: The scan takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.
```
15. Now, type **pluma Nikto_Scan_Results** and press **Enter** to open the created file in a text editor window. The file appears displaying
    the scanned results, as shown in the screenshot.
16. This concludes the demonstration of checking vulnerabilities in the target website using Nikto.
17. Close all open windows and document all the acquired information.
