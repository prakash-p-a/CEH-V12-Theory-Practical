# Module 07: Malware Threats

## Scenario

Malware poses a major security threat to information security. Malware writers explore new attack vectors to exploit vulnerabilities in
information systems. This leads to ever more sophisticated malware attacks, including drive-by malware, “maladvertising” (or
“malvertising”) and advanced persistent threats. Although organizations try hard to defend themselves using comprehensive security
policies and advanced anti-malware controls, the current trend indicates that malware applications are targeting “lower-hanging fruit”;
these include unsecured smartphones, mobile applications, social media, and cloud services. This problem is further complicated, because
of the challenges faced during threat prediction.

Assessing an organization’s information system against malware threats is a major challenge today, because of the rapidly changing
nature of malware threats. One needs to be well-versed in the latest developments in the field and understand the basic functioning of
malware to select and implement the controls appropriate for an organization and its needs.

The lab activities in this module provide first-hand experience with various techniques that attackers use to write and propagate malware.
You will also learn how to effectively select security controls to protect your information assets from malware threats.

## Objective

The objective of the lab is to create malware and perform other tasks that include, but are not limited to:

```
Create a Trojan and exploit a target machine
Create a virus to infect the target machine
Perform malware analysis to determine the origin, functionality, and potential impact of a given type of malware
Detect malware
```
## Overview of Malware

With the help of a malicious application (malware), an attacker gains access to stored passwords in a computer and is able to read
personal documents, delete files, display pictures, or messages on the screen, slow down computers, steal personal information, send
spam, and commit fraud. Malware can perform various malicious activities that range from simple email advertising to complex identity
theft and password stealing.

Programmers develop malware and use it to:

```
Attack browsers and track websites visited
Affect system performance, making it very slow
Cause hardware failure, rendering computers inoperable
Steal personal information, including contacts
Erase valuable information, resulting in substantial data losses
Attack additional computer systems directly from a compromised system
Spam inboxes with advertising emails
```
## Lab Tasks

Note: Ensure that the **Windows Defender Firewall is Turn off** on the machines you are using for the lab tasks in this module, as it blocks
and deletes malware as soon as it is executed.

Attackers, as well as ethical hackers or pen testers, use numerous tools and techniques to gain access to the target network or machine.
Recommended labs that will assist you in learning various malware attack techniques include:

1. Gain access to the target system using Trojans
    Gain control over a victim machine using the njRAT RAT Trojan
    Hide a Trojan using SwayzCryptor and make it undetectable to various anti-virus programs
    Create a Trojan server using Theef RAT Trojan
2. Infect the target system using a virus
    Create a virus using the JPS Virus Maker Tool and infect the target system
3. Perform static malware analysis
    Perform malware scanning using Hybrid Analysis
    Perform a strings search using BinText

    Perform DNS monitoring using DNSQuerySniffer

# Lab 1: Gain Access to the Target System using Trojans

**Lab Scenario**

Attackers use digital Trojan horses to trick the victim into performing a predefined action on a computer. Trojans are activated upon users’
specific predefined actions, like unintentionally installing a piece of malicious software or clicking on a malicious link, and upon activation,
it can grant attackers unrestricted access to all data stored on compromised information systems and cause potentially immense damage.
For example, users could download a file that appears to be a movie, but, when opened, it unleashes a dangerous program that erases the
hard drive or sends credit card numbers and passwords to the attacker.

Trojan horses work on the same level of privileges as victims. For example, if a victim has the privileges to delete files, transmit
information, modify existing files, and install other programs (such as programs that provide unauthorized network access and execute
privilege elevation attacks), once the Trojan infects that system, it will possess the same privileges. Furthermore, it can attempt to exploit
vulnerabilities to increase its level of access, even beyond the user running it. If successful, the Trojan could use the increased privileges to
install other malicious code on the victim’s machine.

An expert security auditor or ethical hacker needs to ensure that the organization’s network is secure from Trojan attacks by finding
machines vulnerable to these attacks and making sure that anti-virus tools are properly configured to detect such attacks.

The lab tasks in this exercise demonstrate how easily hackers can gain access to the target systems in the organization and create a covert
communication channel for transferring sensitive data between the victim computer and the attacker.

**Lab Objectives**

```
Gain control over a victim machine using the njRAT RAT Trojan
Hide a Trojan using SwayzCryptor and make it undetectable to various anti-virus programs
Create a Trojan server using Theef RAT Trojan
```
**Overview of Trojans**

In Ancient Greek mythology, the Greeks won the Trojan War with the aid of a giant wooden horse that the Greeks built to hide their
soldiers. The Greeks left the horse in front of the gates of Troy. The Trojans, thinking that it was a gift from the Greeks that they had left
before apparently withdrawing from the war, brought the horse into their city. At night, the hidden Greek soldiers emerged from the
wooden horse and opened the city’s gates for their soldiers, who eventually destroyed the city of Troy.

Thus, taking its cue from this myth, a computer Trojan is a program in which malicious or harmful code is contained inside apparently
harmless programming or data in such a way that it can gain control and cause damage such as ruining the file allocation table on your
hard disk.

## Task 1: Gain Control over a Victim Machine using the njRAT RAT

## Trojan

Attackers use Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to infect the target machine to gain administrative access. RATs help an attacker to remotely
access the complete GUI and control the victim’s computer without his/her awareness. They can perform screening and camera capture,
code execution, keylogging, file access, password sniffing, registry management, and other tasks. The virus infects victims via phishing
attacks and drive-by downloads and propagates through infected USB keys or networked drives. It can download and execute additional

## malware, execute shell commands, read and write registry keys, capture screenshots, log keystrokes, and spy on webcams. 


njRAT is a RAT with powerful data-stealing capabilities. In addition to logging keystrokes, it is capable of accessing a victim’s camera,
stealing credentials stored in browsers, uploading and downloading files, performing process and file manipulations, and viewing the
victim’s desktop.

This RAT can be used to control Botnets (networks of computers), allowing the attacker to update, uninstall, disconnect, restart, and close
the RAT, and rename its campaign ID. The attacker can further create and configure the malware to spread through USB drives with the
help of the Command and Control server software.

Here, we will use the njRAT Trojan to gain control over a victim machine.

Note: The versions of the created client or host and appearance of the website may differ from what it is in this task. However, the actual
process of creating the server and the client is the same, as shown in this task.

Note: In this lab task, we will use the **Windows 11** ( **10.10.1.11** ) machine as the attacker machine and the **Windows Server 2022**

## Task 2: Hide a Trojan using SwayzCryptor and Make it Undetectable

## to Various Anti-Virus Programs

At present, numerous anti-virus software programs have been configured to detect malware such as Trojans, viruses, and worms. Although
security specialists keep updating the virus definitions, hackers continually try to evade or bypass them. One method that attackers use to
bypass AVs is to “crypt” (an abbreviation of “encrypt”) the malicious files using fully undetectable crypters (FUDs). Crypting these files
allows them to achieve their objectives, and thereby take complete control over the victim’s machine.

Crypter is a software that encrypts the original binary code of the .exe file to hide viruses, spyware, keyloggers, and RATs, among others, in
any kind of file to make them undetectable by anti-viruses. SwayzCryptor is an encrypter (or “crypter”) that allows users to encrypt their
program’s source code.

Here, we will use the SwayzCryptor to hide a Trojan and make it undetectable by anti-virus software.

1. Click **CEHv12 Windows 11** to switch to the **Windows 11** machine, open any web browser (here, **Google Chrome** ). In the address
    bar of the browser place your mouse cursor and type **https://www.virustotal.com** and press **Enter**.
2. The **VirusTotal** main analysis site appears; click **Choose file** to upload a virus file.
3. An **Open** dialog box appears; navigate to the location where you saved the malware file **Test.exe** in the previous task ( **Desktop** ),
    select it, and click **Open**.

### 


4. Click **Confirm upload** on the **VirusTotal** page.
5. The **VirusTotal** uploads the file, scans it with the various anti-virus programs in its database. After the completion of the scan, the

### scan result appears, as shown in the screenshot. 


6. You can see that **59** out of **69** anti-virus programs have detected **Test.exe** as a malicious file. Minimize the web browser window.

```
Note: The detection ratio might vary when you perform this task.

### 


11. The **Save File** dialog-box appears; select the location where you want to store the crypted file (here, **Desktop** ), leave the file name
    set to its default ( **CryptedFile** ), and click **Save**.

### 12. Once the encryption is finished, click Close. 


13. Maximize the web browser (here, **Google Chrome** ). In the VirusTotal analysis page, click the **Upload file** icon in the top-right corner
    of the page.

### 


14. An **Open** dialog-box appears; navigate to the location where you saved the encrypted file **CryptedFile.exe** ( **Desktop** ), select the file,
    and click **Open**.
15. Click **Confirm upload**.

### 


16. VirusTotal uploads the file and begins to scan it with the various anti-virus programs in its database. After the completion of the
    scan, the scan result appears, as shown in the screenshot.

### 


17. Only a few anti-virus programs have detected **CryptedFile.exe** as a malicious file. Minimize or close the browser window.
18. Now, we will test the functioning of a Crypted file ( **CryptedFile.exe** ).
19. Go to **E:\CEH-Tools\CEHv12 Module 07 Malware Threats\Trojans Types\Remote Access Trojans (RAT)\njRAT** , double-click the
    **njRAT v0.7d.exe** file and launch **njRAT** by choosing the default port number **5552** , and then click **Start**.
20. In this exercise, we have already created a crypted file ( **CryptedFile.exe** ), built using njRAT.

### 


21. Use any technique to send **CryptedFile.exe** to the intended target—through email or any other source (In real-time, attackers send
    this server to the victim).

```
Note: In this task, we copied the CryptedFile.exe file to the shared network location ( CEH-Tools ) to share the file.
```
### 

    attacker (here, you) sent the server executable, to the **Desktop** of **Windows Server 2022**.
24. Here, you are acting both as the **attacker** who logs into the **Windows 11** machine to create a malicious server and as the victim who
    logs into the **Windows Server 2022** machine and downloads the server.
25. Double-click **CryptedFile.exe** to run this malicious executable.

```
Note: If You must restart your computer to turn off User Account Control pop-up appears in the right-bottom corner of the
window, then Restart the Windows Server 2022 machine and click Ctrl+Alt+Del to activate the machine, by default,
CEH\Administrator account is selected, type Pa$$w0rd in the Password field and press Enter.
```
### 


26. As soon as the victim (here, **you** ) double-clicks the server, the executable starts running, and the njRAT client (njRAT GUI) running on
    the **Windows 11** machine establishes a persistent connection with the victim machine.
27. Click **CEHv12 Windows 11** to switch to the **Windows 11** machine and in the njRAT window you can observe that the connection
    has been established with the victim machine.

### 


28. Unless the attacker working on the **Windows 11** machine disconnects the server on their own, the victim machine remains under
    their control.
29. Thus, you have created an undetectable Trojan that can bypass the anti-virus and firewall programs, as well as be used to maintain a
    persistent connection with the victim.
30. On completion of this lab, click **CEHv12 Windows Server 2022** to switch to the **Windows Server 2022** machine, launch **Task**
    **Manager** , click on **More details** and look for the **server.exe (32 bit)** process, and click **End task** on the **Windows Server 2022**

# Lab 2: Infect the Target System using a Virus

**Lab Scenario**

Viruses are the scourges of modern computing. Computer viruses have the potential to wreak havoc on both business and personal
computers. The lifetime of a virus depends on its ability to reproduce. Therefore, attackers design every virus code in such a manner that
the virus replicates itself n number of times, where n is a number specified by the attacker. Worldwide, most businesses have been
infected by a virus at some point. Like a biological virus, a computer virus is contagious and can contaminate other files; however, viruses
can only infect outside machines with the assistance of computer users.

Like viruses, computer worms are standalone malicious programs that independently replicate, execute, and spread across network
connections, without human intervention. Worms are a subtype of virus. Intruders design most worms to replicate and spread across a
network, thus consuming available computing resources and, in turn, causing network servers, web servers, and individual computer
systems to become overloaded and stop responding. However, some worms also carry a payload to damage the host system.

An ethical hacker and pen tester during an audit of a target organization must determine whether viruses and worms can damage or steal
the organization’s information. They might need to construct viruses and worms and try to inject them into the target network to check
their behavior, learn whether an anti-virus will detect them, and find out whether they can bypass the firewall.

**Lab Objectives**

```
Create a virus using the JPS Virus Maker Tool and infect the target system

Viruses can attack a target host’s system using a variety of methods. They can attach themselves to programs and transmit themselves to
other programs by making use of specific events. Viruses need such events to take place, since they cannot self-start, infect hardware, or
transmit themselves using non-executable files. “Trigger” and “direct attack” events can cause a virus to activate and infect the target
system when the user triggers attachments received through email, Web sites, malicious advertisements, flashcards, pop-ups, or other
methods. The virus can then attack a system’s built-in programs, antivirus software, data files, and system startup settings, or perform
other malicious activities.

Like a virus, a worm does not require a host to replicate, but in some cases, the worm’s host machine also infects. At first, Blackhat
professionals treated worms as a mainframe problem. Later, with the introduction of the Internet, they concentrated and targeted
Windows OSes using the same worms by sharing them by email, IRC, and other network functions.

## Task 1: Create a Virus using the JPS Virus Maker Tool and Infect the

# Lab 3: Perform Static Malware Analysis

**Lab Scenario**

Attackers use sophisticated malware techniques as cyber weapons to steal sensitive data. Malware can inflict intellectual and financial
losses on the target, be it an individual, a group of people, or an organization. The worst part is that it spreads from one system to another
with ease and stealth.

Malware such as viruses, Trojans, worms, spyware, and rootkits allow an attacker to breach security defenses and subsequently launch
attacks on target systems. Thus, to find and cure the existing infections and thwart future problems, it is necessary to perform malware
analysis. Many tools and techniques exist to perform such tasks. Malware analysis provides an in-depth understanding of each individual
sample and identifies emerging technology trends from large collections of malware samples without executing them. The samples of
malware are mostly compatible with the Windows binary executable.

By performing malware analysis, detailed information regarding the malware can be extracted. This information includes items like the
malicious intent of the malware, indicators of compromise, complexity level of the intruder, exploited vulnerability, extent of damage
caused by the intrusion, perpetrator accountable for installing the malware, and system vulnerability the malware has exploited. An ethical
hacker and pen tester must perform malware analysis to understand the workings of the malware and assess the damage that it may
cause to the information system. Malware analysis is an integral part of any penetration testing process.

Note: It is very dangerous to analyze malware on production devices connected to production networks. Therefore, one should always
analyze malware samples in a testing environment on an isolated network.

**Overview of Static Malware Analysis**

Static Malware Analysis, also known as code analysis, involves going through the executable binary code without executing it to gain a
better understanding of the malware and its purpose. The process includes the use of different tools and techniques to determine the
malicious part of the program or a file. It also gathers information about malware functionality and collects the technical pointers or
simple signatures it generates. Such pointers include file name, MD5 checksums or hashes, file type, and file size. Analyzing the binary
code provides information about the malware’s functionality, network signatures, exploit packaging technique, dependencies involved, as
well as other information.

Some of the static malware analysis techniques are:

```
File fingerprinting
Local and online malware scanning
Performing strings search
Identifying packing and obfuscation methods
Finding portable executable (PE) information
Identifying file dependencies
Malware disassembly
```
## Task 1: Perform Malware Scanning using Hybrid Analysis

Hybrid Analysis is a free service that analyzes suspicious files and URLs and facilitates the quick detection of unknown threats such as
viruses, worms, Trojans, and other kinds of malware.

    scanning.

## Task 2: Perform a Strings Search using BinText

Software programs include some strings that are commands to perform specific functions such as printing output. Strings communicate
information from a program to its user. Various strings that could represent the malicious intent of a program such as reading the internal
memory or cookie data, are embedded in the compiled binary code.

Searching through strings can provide information about the basic functionality of any program. During malware analysis, search for
malicious strings that could determine the harmful actions that a program can perform. For instance, if the program accesses a URL, it will
have that URL string stored in it. You should be attentive while looking for strings and search for the embedded and encrypted strings for
a complete analysis of the suspect file.

BinText is a text extractor that can extract text from any file. It includes the ability to find plain ASCII text, Unicode text, and Resource
strings, providing useful information for each item.

Here, we will use the BinText tool to extract embedded strings from executable files.

1. On the **Windows 11** machine, navigate to **E:\CEH-Tools\CEHv12 Module 07 Malware Threats\Malware Analysis Tools\Static**
    **Malware Analysis Tools\String Searching Tools\BinText** and double-click **bintext.exe**.

    (double byte ANSI) have a red “U,” and resource strings have a blue “R.”

### 8. “File pos” is the HEX position at which the text is located in the file. 


9. “Mem pos” if the file is a Win32 PE file (such as Win95 EXEs and DLLs), then this is the HEX address at which the text is referred to in
    the memory at runtime, as determined by its sections table.
10. “ID” is the decimal string resource ID or 0 if it is not a resource string.
11. Close all windows once the analysis is complete.
12. You can also use other string searching tools such as **FLOSS** (https://www.fireeye.com), **Strings** (https://docs.microsoft.com), **Free
EXE DLL Resource Extract** (https://www.resourceextract.com), or **FileSeek** (https://www.fileseek.ca) to perform string search.

## Task 3: Identify Packaging and Obfuscation Methods using PEid

Attackers often use packing and obfuscation or a packer to compress, encrypt, or modify a malware executable file to avoid detection.
Obfuscation also hides the execution of the programs. When the user executes a packed program, it also runs a small wrapper program to
decompress the packed file, and then runs the unpacked file. It complicates the task of reverse engineers to determine the actual program
logic and other metadata via static analysis. The best approach is to try and identify if the file includes packed elements and locate the
tool or method used to pack it.

PEid is a free tool that provides details about Windows executable files. It can identify signatures associated with over 600 different
packers and compilers. This tool also displays the type of packer used in packing a program.

Here, we will use the PEid tool to detect common packers, cryptors, and compilers for PE executable files.

1. In the **Windows 11** machine, navigate to **E:\CEH-Tools\CEHv12 Module 07 Malware Threats\Malware Analysis Tools\Static**
    **Malware Analysis Tools\Packaging and Obfuscation Tools\PEid** and double-click **PEiD.exe**.

5. Close all windows once the analysis is complete.

### 


## Task 4: Analyze ELF Executable File using Detect It Easy (DIE)

The Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) is a generic executable file format in Linux environment. It contains three main components
including ELF header, sections, and segments. Each component plays an independent role in the loading and execution of ELF executables.
The static analysis of an ELF file involves investigating an ELF executable file without running or installing it. It also involves accessing the
binary code and extracting valuable artifacts from the program. Numerous tools can be used to perform static analysis on ELF files. In this
task, we will be using Detect It Easy (DIE) tool to analyze ELF file.

Detect It Easy (DIE) is an application used for determining the types of files. Apart from the Windows, DIE is also available for Linux and
Mac OS. It has a completely open architecture of signatures and can easily add its own algorithms for detecting or modifying the existing
signatures. It detects a file’s compiler, linker, packer, etc. using a signature-based detection method.

**ASPack** (http://www.aspack.com) to identify packing/obfuscation methods.

## Task 5: Find the Portable Executable (PE) Information of a Malware

## Executable File using PE Explorer

The Portable Executable (PE) format is the executable file format used on Windows OSes that stores the information a Windows system
requires to manage the executable code. The PE stores metadata about the program, which helps in finding additional details of the file.
For instance, the Windows binary is in PE format that consists of information such as time of creation and modification, import and export
functions, compilation time, DLLs, and linked files, as well as strings, menus, and symbols.

PE Explorer lets you open, view, and edit a variety of different 32-bit Windows executable file types (also called PE files) ranging from
common such as EXE, DLL, and ActiveX Controls to less familiar types such as SCR (Screensavers), CPL (Control Panel Applets), SYS,
MSSTYLES, BPL, DPL, and more (including executable files that run on MS Windows Mobile platform).

Here, we will use the PE Explorer tool to view the PE information of a malware executable file.

1. On the **Windows 11** machine, navigate to **E:\CEH-Tools\CEHv12 Module 07 Malware Threats\Malware Analysis Tools\Static**
    **Malware Analysis Tools\PE Extraction Tools\PE Explorer** and double-click **PE.Explorer_setup.exe**.

    (http://www.angusj.com), or **PEView** (https://www.aldeid.com) to find the Portable Executable (PE) information of a malware
    executable file.

## Task 6: Identify File Dependencies using Dependency Walker

Any software program depends on the various inbuilt libraries of an OS that help in performing specified actions in a system. Programs
need to work with internal system files to function correctly. Programs store their import and export functions in a kernel32.dll file. File
dependencies contain information about the internal system files that the program needs to function properly; this includes the process of
registration and location on the machine.

Find the libraries and file dependencies, as they contain information about the run-time requirements of an application. Then, check to
find and analyze these files to provide information about the malware in the file. File dependencies include linked libraries, functions, and
function calls. Check the dynamically linked list in the malware executable file. Finding out all library functions may allow guessing about
what the malware program can do. You should know the various DLLs used to load and run a program.

Some of the standard DLLs are:

### 


The Dependency Walker tool lists all dependent modules of an executable file and builds hierarchical tree diagrams. It also records all
functions that each module exports and calls. Further, it detects many common application problems such as missing and invalid modules,
import and export mismatches, circular dependency errors, mismatched machine modules, and module initialization failures.

Here, we will use the Dependency Walker tool to identify the file dependencies of an executable file.

1. On the **Windows 11** machine, navigate to **E:\CEH-Tools\CEHv12 Module 07 Malware Threats\Malware Analysis Tools\Static**
    **Malware Analysis Tools\File Dependency Checking Tools\Dependency Walker** , and double-click **depends.exe**.

    in the screenshot.

### 


10. Analyze all DLL dependencies of the imported malicious file. Close all open windows once the analysis is complete.
11. You can also use other dependency checking tools such as **Dependency-check** (https://jeremylong.github.io), **Snyk** (https://snyk.io),
    or **RetireJS** (https://retirejs.github.io) to identify file dependencies.

## Task 7: Perform Malware Disassembly using IDA and OllyDbg

Static analysis also includes the dismantling of a given executable into binary format to study its functionalities and features. This process
helps identify the language used for programming the malware, look for APIs that reveal its function, and retrieve other information.
Based on the reconstructed assembly code, you can inspect the program logic and recognize its threat potential. This process uses
debugging tools such as IDA Pro and OllyDbg.

**IDA** As a disassembler, IDA explores binary programs, for which the source code might not be available, to create maps of their execution.
The primary purpose of a disassembler is to display the instructions actually executed by the processor in a symbolic representation called
“assembly language.” However, in real life, things are not always simple. Hostile code usually does not cooperate with the analyst. Viruses,
worms, and Trojans are often armored and obfuscated; as such, more powerful tools are required. The debugger in IDA complements the
static analysis capabilities of the disassembler. By allowing an analyst to single-step through the code being investigated, the debugger
often bypasses the obfuscation. It helps obtain data that the more powerful static disassembler will be able to process in depth.

**OllyDbg** OllyDbg is a debugger that emphasizes binary code analysis, which is useful when source code is unavailable. It traces registers,
recognizes procedures, API calls switches, tables, constants, and strings, and locates routines from object files and libraries.

There is a new debugging option, “Set permanent breakpoints on system calls.” When active, it requests OllyDbg to set breakpoints on
KERNEL32.UnhandledExceptionFilter(), NTDLL.KiUserExceptionDispatcher(), NTDLL.ZwContinue(), and NTDLL.NtQueryInformationProcess().

# Lab 4: Perform Dynamic Malware Analysis

**Lab Scenario**

Dynamic Malware Analysis, also known as behavioral analysis, involves executing malware code to learn how it interacts with the host
system and its impact after infecting the system.

Dynamic analysis involves the execution of malware to examine its conduct and operations and identify technical signatures that confirm
the malicious intent. It reveals information such as domain names, file path locations, created registry keys, IP addresses, additional files,
installation files, and DLL and linked files located on the system or network.

This type of analysis requires a safe environment such as machines and sandboxes to deter the spreading of malware. The environment
design should include tools that can capture every movement of the malware in detail and give feedback. Typically, systems act as a base
for conducting such experiments.

An ethical hacker and pen tester must perform dynamic malware analysis to find out about the applications and processes running on a
computer and remove unwanted or malicious programs that can breach privacy or affect the system’s health.

**Lab Objectives**

```
Perform port monitoring using TCPView and CurrPorts
Perform process monitoring using Process Monitor
Perform registry monitoring using Reg Organizer
Perform Windows services monitoring using Windows Service Manager (SrvMan)
Perform startup program monitoring using Autoruns for Windows and WinPatrol
Perform installation monitoring using Mirekusoft Install Monitor
```
## Perform files and folder monitoring using PA File Sight 


```
Perform device driver monitoring using DriverView and Driver Reviver
Perform DNS monitoring using DNSQuerySniffer
```
**Overview of Dynamic Malware Analysis**

Dynamic analysis is performed to gather valuable information about malware activity, including the files and folders created, ports and
URLs accessed, called functions and libraries, applications and tools accessed, information transferred, settings modified processes, and
services the malware started, and other items. You should design and set up the environment for performing the dynamic analysis in such
a way that the malware cannot propagate to the production network, and ensure that the testing system can recover to an earlier set
timeframe (prior to launching the malware) in case anything goes wrong during the test.

To achieve this, you need to perform the following:

```
System Baselining Baselining refers to the process of capturing a system’s state (taking snapshot of the system) at the time the
malware analysis begins. This can be used to compare the system’s state after executing the malware file, which will help understand
the changes that the malware has made across the system. A system baseline involves recording details of the file system, registry,
open ports, network activity, and other items.
```
```
Host Integrity Monitoring Host integrity monitoring is the process of studying the changes that have taken place across a system
or a machine after a series of actions or incidents. It involves using the same tools to take a snapshot of the system before and after
the incident or actions and analyzing the changes to evaluate the malware’s impact on the system and its properties. In malware
analysis, host integrity monitoring helps to understand the runtime behavior of a malware file as well as its activities, propagation
techniques, URLs accessed, downloads initiated, and other characteristics.
```
```
Host integrity monitoring includes:
```
```
Port monitoring
Process monitoring
Registry monitoring
Windows services monitoring
Startup program monitoring
Event logs monitoring and analysis
Installation monitoring
Files and folder monitoring
Device driver monitoring
Network traffic monitoring and analysis
DNS monitoring and resolution
API calls monitoring
```
## Task 1: Perform Port Monitoring using TCPView and CurrPorts

We know that the Internet uses a software protocol named TCP/IP to format and transfer data. Malware programs corrupt the system and
open system input and output ports to establish connections with remote systems, networks, or servers to accomplish various malicious
tasks. These open ports can also act as backdoors or communication channels for other types of harmful malware and programs. They
open unused ports on the victim’s machine to connect back to the malware handlers.

You can identify the malware trying to access a particular port by installing port monitoring tools such as TCPView and CurrPorts.

**TCPView** TCPView is a Windows program that shows the detailed listings of all the TCP and UDP endpoints on the system, including the
local and remote addresses, and the state of the TCP connections. It provides a subset of the Netstat program that ships with Windows.
The TCPView download includes Tcpvcon, a command-line version with the same functionality. When TCPView runs, it enumerates all
active TCP and UDP endpoints, resolving all IP addresses to their domain name versions.

**CurrPorts** CurrPorts is a piece of network monitoring software that displays a list of all the currently open TCP/IP and UDP ports on a local
computer. For each port in the list, information about the process that opened the port is also displayed, including the process name, full
path of the process, version information of the process (product name, file description, etc.), the time that the process was created, and
the user that created it.

In addition, CurrPorts allows you to close unwanted TCP connections, kill the process that opened the ports, and save the TCP/UDP port
information to an HTML file, XML file, or to tab-delimited text file.

CurrPorts also automatically marks suspicious TCP/UDP ports owned by unidentified applications (Applications without version
information and icons) in pink.

### 


Note: This lab activity demonstrates how to analyze malicious processes running on a machine using TCPView and CurrPorts. Here, you
will first create a server using njRAT, and then execute this server from the second machine. Later, you will run the TCPView and CurrPorts

    through the port unless you open it.
30. Normally, when the **CurrPorts** dialog-box appears, you would click **Yes** to close the connection. However, do not Kill the process at
    this step, as this running process will be used for the next task; click **No**.

### 


31. This way, you can analyze the ports open on a machine and the processes running on it.
32. If a process is found to be suspicious, you may either kill the process or close the port.
33. Close all open windows.
34. You can also use other port monitoring tools such as **Port Monitor** (https://www.port-monitor.com), **TCP Port Monitoring**
    (https://www.dotcom-monitor.com), or **PortExpert** (https://www.kcsoftwares.com) to perform port monitoring.

## Task 2: Perform Process Monitoring using Process Monitor

Process monitoring will help in understanding the processes that malware initiates and takes over after execution. You should also observe
the child processes, associated handles, loaded libraries, functions, and execution flow of boot time processes to define the entire nature
of a file or program, gather information about processes running before the execution of the malware, and compare them with the
processes running after execution. This method will reduce the time taken to analyze the processes and help in easy identification of all
processes that malware starts.

Process Monitor is a monitoring tool for Windows that shows the real-time file system, Registry, and process and thread activity. It
combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon. It adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich
and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread
stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, and simultaneous logging to a file. Unique features of Process Monitor make it
a core utility in system troubleshooting and vital to the malware hunting toolkit.

Here, we will use the Process Monitor tool to detect suspicious processes.

    (https://www.manageengine.com), **Monit** (https://mmonit.com), or **ESET SysInspector** (https://www.eset.com) to perform process
    monitoring.

## Task 3: Perform Registry Monitoring using Reg Organizer

The Windows Registry stores OS and program configuration details such as settings and options. If the malware is a program, the registry
stores its functionality. When an attacker installs a type of malware on the victim’s machine, it generates a registry entry. One must have
fair knowledge of the Windows Registry, its contents, and inner workings to analyze the presence of malware. Scanning for suspicious
registries will help to detect malware. While most computer users generally do not do this, monitoring the registry entries is a great way to
track any modifications made to your system.

Registry monitoring tools such as Reg Organizer provide a simple way to track registry modifications, which is useful in troubleshooting
and monitoring background changes.

**Reg Organizer**

Reg Organizer is designed to edit keys and parameters, as well as to delete the content of.reg files. It allows users to perform various
operations with the system registry such as export, import and copy key values. It can also perform a deep searches to find even those
keys associated with the application that cannot be found by other similar programs.

    perform registry monitoring.

## Task 4: Perform Windows Services Monitoring using Windows Service

## Manager (SrvMan)

Attackers design malware and other malicious code in such a way that they install and run on a computer device in the form of a service.
As most services run in the background to support processes and applications, malicious services are invisible, even when they are
performing harmful activities on the system, and can even function without intervention or input. Malware spawns Windows services that
allow attackers to control the victim machine and pass malicious instructions remotely. Malware may also employ rootkit techniques to
manipulate the following registry keys to hide their processes and services.

**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services** These malicious services run as the SYSTEM account or another privileged
account, which provides more access compared to regular user accounts, making them more dangerous than common malware and
executable code. Attackers also try to conceal their actions by naming the malicious services with the names similar to genuine Windows
services to avoid detection.

You can trace malicious services initiated by the suspect file during dynamic analysis by using Windows service monitoring tools such as
Windows Service Manager (SrvMan), which can detect changes in services and scan for suspicious Windows services.

SrvMan has both GUI and Command-line modes. It can also be used to run arbitrary Win32 applications as services (when such a service is
stopped, the main application window automatically closes).

Here, we will use the SrvMan tool to check for suspicious windows services.

1. On the **Windows 11** machine, navigate to **E:\CEH-Tools\CEHv12 Module 07 Malware Threats\Malware Analysis Tools\Dynamic**
    **Malware Analysis Tools\Windows Services Monitoring Tools\Windows Service Manager (SrvMan)\x64** and double-click
    **srvman.exe**.

```
Note: You can choose any of the executable files for the Windows Service Manager according to your computer and OS design.
```
2. If a **User Account Control** window appears, click **Yes**.

### 


3. The **Service Manager** main window appears, listing all services available or running on the machine, as shown in the screenshot.
4. The Service Manager shows the **Internal name** , **State** , **Type** , **Display name** , **Start type** , and **Executable** data of the services.
5. Here, you can choose any unwanted service that is running on your computer, and **Stop** or **Delete** that service by choosing the
    appropriate action.
6. You can view the properties of the selected service by clicking on **Properties**.

    (https://securityxploded.com), **Process Hacker** (https://processhacker.sourceforge.io), **Netwrix Service Monitor**
    (https://www.netwrix.com), or **AnVir Task Manager** (https://www.anvir.com) to perform Windows services monitoring.

## Task 5: Perform Startup Program Monitoring using Autoruns for

## Windows and WinPatrol

Startup programs are applications or processes that start when your system boots up. Attackers make many malicious programs such as
Trojans and worms in such a way that they are executed during startup, and the user is unaware of the malicious program running in the
background.

An ethical hacker or penetration tester must identify the applications or processes that start when a system boots up and remove any
unwanted or malicious programs that can breach privacy or affect a system’s health. Therefore, scanning for suspicious startup programs
manually or using startup program monitoring tools like Autoruns for Windows and WinPatrol is essential for detecting malware.

**Autoruns for Windows** This utility can auto-start the location of any startup monitor, display which programs are configured to run
during system bootup or login, and show the entries in the order Windows processes them. As soon as this program is included in the
startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys, users can configure Autoruns to show other locations, including Explorer shell
extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, and auto-start services. Autoruns’ Hide Signed Microsoft Entries
option helps the user zoom in on third-party auto-starting images that add to the users’ system, and it has support for looking at the
auto-starting images configured for other accounts configured on the system.

**WinPatrol** WinPatrol provides the user with 14 different tabs to help in monitoring the system and its files. This security utility gives the
user a chance to look for programs that are running in the background of a system so that the user can take a closer look and control the
execution of legitimate and malicious programs.
